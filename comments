// Question: What is server in general?
// Answer: Server is considered both Hardware & Software component. It is used to communicate with client.
//  But mostly it is a software component.

// Whenever we made any API like I did above, we have to send it to any cloud storage so that my server is accessible to all users.
// So actually we do cloud computing. Like we sent our server to cloud service providers like Google, AWS etc.
// Port: Handling request and response of client and server.
